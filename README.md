# Understanding Punctuation

A guide on understanding proper punctuation, grammar, etc. This guide is going to be in-depth and somewhat complex. It is currently a WIP (work in progress), and as of now, it is not finished, so I don't expect much. But, it will be finished sometime.

If you wish to contribute to this, you can make a PR, and if you wish to go through and remake this readme, go ahead!

# Using Periods
----
Use a period to signal the end of most sentences, including direct questions.

Also, use periods in most abbreviations.

- Mr. Spock
- Aug.
- Dr. Livingstone
- 9 p.m.
- etc.
- 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.

If an abbreviation ends the sentence, do not add another period.

- He promised to be there at 6 a.m. <- Period signaling the end; it is part of the abbreviation.

However, do add a question mark if the sentence is a question.

- Did he arrive at 6 p.m.?

If the abbreviation falls within a sentence, use normal punctuation after the period.

- He promised to be there at 6 p.m., but he forgot.

Familiar abbreviations of names of corporations or government agencies and abbreviations of scientific and technical terms do not require periods.

- TMZ
- NYPD
- DNA
- CIA
- WCAU-FM
- NFL

**Acronyms**—new words formed from the initial letters or first few letters of a series of words—do not include periods.

- hazmat
- Nascar
- NATO
- modem

**Clipped forms** (commonly accepted shortened forms of words, such as gym, dorm, math, and fax) do not use periods.

**Postal abbreviations** do not include periods.

- TX
- CA
- MS
- PA
- FL
- NY

Use periods to mark divisions in dramatic, poetic, and biblical references.

- Hamlet 2.2.-5 (act, scene, lines)
- Paradise Lost 7.163-167 (book, lines)
- Judges 4.14 (chapter, verse)

Note: In __MLA parenthetical references__, titles of classic literary works and books of the Bible are often abbreviated:

> (Ham. 2.2.1-5); (Judg. 4.14).

When you type an electronic address (URL), do not end it with a period, and do not add spaces or periods within the address.

----

# Using Question Marks
----
Use a question mark to signal the end of a direct question.

- Who was at the door?

Use a question mark in parentheses to indicate uncertainty about a date or number.

- Aristophanes, the Greek playwright, was born in 448 (?) BC and died in 380 (?) BC.

Use a period, not a question mark, with an indirect question. 

- Wrong: The personnel officer asked whether he knew how to type?
- Correct: The personnel officer asked whether he knew how to type.

Do not use a question mark to convey sarcasm. Instead, suggest your attitude through your choice of words

- Wrong: I refused his generous offer.
- Correct: I refused his **not very** generous offer.

----

# Using Exclamation Points
----
An exclamation point is used to signal the end of an emotional or emphatic statement, an emphatic interjection, or a forceful command.

- Remember the Maine!
- "No! Don't leave!" he cried.

Note: Except for recording dialogue, do not use exclamation points in college writing. Even in informal writing, use exclamation points sparingly—and never use two or more in a row.

Use a comma when you form a compound sentence by linking two independent clauses with a __coordinating conjunction__ (and, but, or, nor, for, yet, so) or with a pair of __correlative conjunctions__.

- The House approved the bill, but the Senate rejected it.
- Either the hard drive is full, or the modem is too slow.

Note: You may omit the comma if two clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction are very short: Love it or leave it. (The comma would go between *it* and *or* in other cases).

----

# Setting Off Items in a Series
----
Use commas between items in a series of three or more **coordinate elements** (words, phrases, or clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction).

- Chipmunk, raccoon, and Mugwump are Native American words.
- You may pay by check, with a credit or debit card, or in cash.
- Brazilians speak Portuguese, Colombians speak Spanish, and Haitians speak French and Creole.

Note: To avoid ambiguity, use a comma before the _and_ (or other coordinating conjunction) that separates the last two items in a series: He was inspired by his parents, the Dalai Lama's, and Mother Teresa.

Use a comma between items in a series of two or more **coordinate adjectives**—adjectives that modify the same word or word group—unless they are joined by a conjunction.

- She brushed her long, shining hair.
- The baby was tired and cranky and wet. (no commas required)

----

# Setting off Introductory Elements
----
An introductory dependent clause, verbal phrase, or prepositional phrase is generally set off from the rest of the sentence by a comma.

- When war came to Baghdad, many victims were children. (dependent clause)

If an introductory _dependent clause_ is short and designates time, you may omit the comma—provided the sentence will be clear without it: When I exercise I drink plenty of water. (The comma would go between **exercise** and **I** in other cases).

- Pushing onward, Scott struggled toward the South Pole. (verbal phrase)
- During the Depression, movie attendance rose. (prepositional phrase)

If an introductory prepositional phrase is short and no ambiguity is possible, you may omit the comma: After lunch I took a four-hour nap. (The comma would go between **lunch** and **I** in other cases).

----

# Nonrestrictive Modifiers
----
Use commas to set off nonessential material whether it appears at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a sentence.

Use commas to set off nonrestrictive modifiers, which supply information that is not essential to the meaning of the words they modify. (Do not use commas to set off restrictive modifiers, which supply information that is essential to the meaning of the words they modify.)

- Nonrestrictive (commas required): Actors, who have inflated egos, are often insecure. (All actors—not just those with inflated egos—are insecure.)

- Restrictive (no commas): Actors who have inflated egos are often insecure. (Only those actors with inflated egos—not all actors—are insecure.)

In the following examples, commas set off only nonrestrictive modifiers—those that supply nonessential information. Commas do not set off restrictive modifiers, which supply essential information.

----

### Adjective Clauses
----
- Nonrestrictive: He ran for the bus, which was late as usual.
- Restrictive: Speaking in public is something that most people fear.

----

### Prepositional Phrases
----
- Nonrestrictive: The clerk, with a nod, dismissed me.
- Restrictive: The man with the gun demanded their money.

----

### Verbal Phrases
----
- Nonrestrictive: The marathoner, running his fastest, beat his previous record.
- Restrictive: The candidates running for mayor have agreed to a debate.

----

### Appositives
----
- Nonrestrictive: Citizen Kane, Orson Welles's first film, made him famous.
- Restrictive: The film Citizen Kane made Orson Welles famous.

----

# Transitional Words and Phrases
----
__Transitional words and phrases__ qualify, clarify, and make connections. Because they are not essential to the sentence's meaning, however, they are always set off by commas when they interrupt a clause or when they begin or end a sentence.

- The Outward Bound program, for example, is considered safe.
- In fact, Outward Bound has an excellent reputation. Other programs are not so safe, however.

Note: When a transitional word or phrase joins two independent clauses, it must be preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma; _Laughter is the best medicine; of course penicillin also comes in handy sometimes._

----

### Contradictory Phrases
----
A phrase that expresses a contradiction is usually set off from the rest of the sentence by one or more commas.

* Contradictory: This medicine is taken after meals, _never on an empty stomach_.
* Not Contradictory: Jonas Salk, _not Albert Sabin_, developed the first polio vaccine.

----

### Miscellaneous Nonessential Elements
----
Other nonessential elements usually set off by commas include tag questions, names in direct address, mild interjections, and _yes_ and _no_.

* This is your first day on the job, isn't it?
* I wonder, Mr. Honeywell, whether Mr. Albright deserves a raise.
* Well, it's about time.
* Yes, that's what I thought.

----

# Using Commas in Other Conventional Contexts
----
### With Direct Quotations
In most cases, use commas to set off a direct quotation from the **identifying tag**, the phrase that identifies the speaker (_he said, she answered, and so on_).

* Emerson said, "I greet you at the beginning of a great career."
* "I greet you at the beginning of a great career," Emerson said.
* "I greet you," Emerson said, "at the beginning of a great career."

When the identifying tag comes between two complete sentences, however, the tag is introduced by a comma but followed by a period.

* "Winning isn't everything," Coach Vince Lombardi once said. "It's the only thing."

----

### With Titles or Degrees Following a Name
----
* Michael Crichton, MD, wrote Jurassic Park.
* Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is Shakespeare's most famous character.

----

### In Dates and Addresses
----
* On August 30, 1983, the space shuttle Challenger exploded.
* Her address is 600 West End Avenue, New York, NY 10024.

Note: When only the month and year are given, do not use a comma to separate the month from the year: _August 1983_. Do not use a comma to separate the street number from the street or the state name from the zip code.

----

# Using Commas to Prevent Misreading
----
In some cases, a comma is used to avoid ambiguity. For example, consider the following sentence:

* Those who can, sprint the final lap.

Without the comma _can_ appears to be an auxiliary verb ("Those who can sprint ..."), and the sentence seems in-complete. The comma tells readers to pause and thus prevents confusion. Also use a comma to acknowledge the omission of a repeated word, usually a verb, and to separate words repeated consecutively.

* Pam carried the box; Tim, the suitcase.
* Everything bad that could have happened, happened.
